Description
-----------

Webseen.mod is an addon to gseen.mod. Like the name already indicates,
it creates an webinterface to gseen.mod. Just like stats.mod, it starts
its own webserver on a specified port (8044 by default).

It has support for multiple skins and languages.



Installation
------------

Webseen.mod requires gseen.mod to run.

Just install it like every other module. (see gseen's readme for details)

Then copy the templates from the template/ subdir to your template
directory (~/eggdrop/templates, for example) and the langfiles to
your language directory, if they didn't already got copied there by the
installer.

Now copy webseen.conf to your eggdrop directory and edit it to fit your
needs. Finally, just add the line "source webseen.conf" to your eggdrop
config file.
